## How to start

To create a voice assistant for a Flutter app:

1. [Sign up for Alan Studio](https://studio.alan.app/register) to build and test voice scripts.
2. Use this plugin to embed a voice assistant to your app:

 a. In the `pubspec.yaml` file, add the Alan voice dependency:

 ```yaml
 //pubspec.yaml file
 ...
 dependencies:
  flutter:
   sdk: flutter
  ...
  alan_voice: 3.x.xx 
 ```

 b. Add the `alan_voice` package dependency:

 ```dart
 import 'package:alan_voice/alan_voice.dart';
 ```

 c. Add the Alan button to your main widget:

 ```dart
 AlanVoice.addButton(
        "8e0b083e795c924d64635bba9c3571f42e956eca572e1d8b807a3e2338fdd0dc/stage",
        buttonAlign: AlanVoice.BUTTON_ALIGN_LEFT);
 ```

 d. Replace the key above with the Alan SDK key of your project in Alan Studio.

That's it. Now run your app and tap the Alan button!
